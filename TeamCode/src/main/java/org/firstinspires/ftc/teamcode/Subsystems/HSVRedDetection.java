******* NOTE *******
This detection is used for the FTC 2023-2024 CENTERSTAGE Challenge by the CPHS Robolobos (14361)

This code is heavily inspired and guided by team Wolf Corp Robotics 12525 (I love these people)

here's the vid that step by step saved my sanity & explains how this version of HSV color detection works:

I've added some comments abt stuff- Good luck!

        THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE VIDEO!!
        in the video, the detection system is made to find normal stones because they're yellow
        and easy to detect, and depending on where the normal stones are, it knows where the skystone is

        this altered version I've made is for Centerstage, and our TSE colors are either red/blue;
        Which means it's much simpler for us that we only need to detect the color red/blue

        That's why his code is 'reversed'- he's not actually detecting the Skystone- just the normal ones
